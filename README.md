# Description

This example shows the double shadowed root problem with the Webviewer `11.4.0`.
If you install the webviewer in another web component with shadow root, then click events, especially on annotations, no longer seem to be recognized correctly.


# Init Test

* `npm install`
* Start the bild process in the first terminal: `npm run watch`
* Start the preview server in the second terminal: `npm run preview`


# Examples

* You can open the IFrame version via: http://localhost:4173/webcomponent-iframe.html
* The shadowed version is available at: http://localhost:4173/webcomponent-shadowed.html
